# Square.Phys
A little "physics simulation" square game made in Love2D.

Made this somewhere around 2022 while learning about vectors in depth at school.

## How to run the game
1. Download [Love2D](https://love2d.org/), either the installer or the zipped version.
2. Drag and drop the folder containing all the files on top of either `love.exe` or `lovec.exe`
